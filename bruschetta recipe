Ingredients
1 baguette cut in 1/2 inch slices
2 cups tomatoes finely chopped, see recipe notes
2 cloves garlic minced
1/4 medium onion finely chopped
6 leaves basil finely chopped
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese freshly grated
1/4 tsp salt or to taste
1/2 tsp pepper or to taste
3 tbsp olive oil
Optional
1/4 cup balsamic reduction
Instructions
Turn your oven on to the broil setting. Place the baguette slices on a large baking sheet. If preferred you could brush the 
slices with a bit of olive oil on both sides and season with a bit of salt and pepper. Place under the broiler and toast on both sides for about 1 to 2 minutes per side. Set aside.

In a medium size bowl toss together the tomatoes, garlic onion, basil, cheese, salt, pepper and olive oil. Taste for seasoning
and adjust with salt and pepper if needed.

Spoon bruschetta on the toasted bread slices and drizzle with balsamic reduction if preferred.
